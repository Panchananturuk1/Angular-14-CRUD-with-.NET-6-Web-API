# Angular-14-CRUD-with-.NET-6-Web-API

ngular 14 is the latest version of the Angular framework, a popular JavaScript framework for building single-page applications (SPAs). .NET 6 is the latest version of the .NET framework, a popular development platform for building web applications, mobile apps, and cloud services.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a set of basic operations that are performed on data. In the context of Angular 14 and .NET 6, CRUD can be used to create, read, update, and delete data from a database.

To connect Angular 14 with a .NET 6 Web API, you can use the HttpClient service in Angular. The HttpClient service provides methods for sending HTTP requests to a remote server.

Here are the steps involved in connecting Angular 14 with a .NET 6 Web API:

Create a .NET 6 Web API project.
Create a database and tables to store the data.
Create a controller in the Web API project to handle the CRUD operations.
Create an Angular project.
Import the HttpClient service in the Angular project.
Create components in the Angular project to perform the CRUD operations.
Once you have completed these steps, you will be able to create, read, update, and delete data from a database using Angular 14 and .NET 6.

Here are some of the benefits of using Angular 14 and .NET 6 for CRUD applications:

Angular 14 is a modern and powerful JavaScript framework that can be used to create complex and interactive SPAs.
.NET 6 is a mature and reliable development platform that can be used to build a variety of applications.
The HttpClient service in Angular makes it easy to connect to a remote server and perform HTTP requests.
The CRUD operations are implemented in the Web API project, which can be reused in other applications.
